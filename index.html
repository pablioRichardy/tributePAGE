        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ghostemane was born Eric Whitney, on April 15, 1991, in Lake Worth, Florida. His parents had moved to Florida from New York just a year before Eric was born. His father worked as a phlebotomist. Eric grew up with a brother. Soon after he was born, the family moved to a new house in the West Palm Beach area, Florida.</li>
          <li>Ever since he was a kid, Eric was very good in academics. He consistently scored high grades in school. In addition, he also played football almost throughout his childhood.</li>
          <li>He was also a hardcore music lover. He listened to hardcore punk rock when he was growing up. He also became interested in learning music and attended guitar classics.</li>
          <li>He had aspired to become a musician ever since his teenage years. However, having a strict father somehow held him back from trying harder to pursue his dreams. This changed when his father passed away. Eric was 17 years old back then. He was deeply saddened by his father’s death but also gained confidence to do whatever he wanted to do in life.</li>
          <li>His father “forced” him to play football in high school. Later, Eric was “ordered” to join the ‘US Marines.’ However, Eric’s dreams lay somewhere else. He was deeply interested in reading philosophy, the occult, and the sciences. By his mid-teenage years, he had also become highly interested in the doom metal genre of music.</li>
          <li>He scored a high GPA in high school and enrolled at college to study astrophysics. However, he also continued playing in many doom metal bands, such as ‘Nemesis’ and ‘Seven Serpents.’</li>
          <li>Following his college graduation, Eric started focusing on making money. He started doing a call-center job. Sometime later, he landed a high-profile job. However, he was not able to get music out of his system all the while.</li>
